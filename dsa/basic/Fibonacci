import java.util.Scanner;

public class Fibonacci {
public static void main(String [] args) {
	Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
	System.out.print("Enter the position of Fibonacci number: ");
	int n = in.nextInt();
	int a=0;
	int b=1;
	int count =2;
	
	
	while(count<n) {
		int temp =b;
		b=a+b;
		a=temp;
		count++;
		
	}
	System.out.println(b);
}
}
